0.61 Mon 08 November 2004
-------------------------

  * (8 Nov 2004) oh dear, forgot another one

  * (8 Nov 2004) oops, needed to change support files


0.60 Mon 08 November 2004
-------------------------

  * (7 Nov 2004) added hash2fv script
  	The script does a naieve conversion of an AutomatedArchive
  hash database file; it just copies the data Field by Field, which
  makes the most sense, but something I will have to keep in mind for
  later, when using such converted databases.
  	Also, as part of this, added set_from_hash in Tie::FieldVals::Row.

  * (7 Nov 2004) made sort_records (in Tie::FieldVals::Select) more efficient


0.50 Sun 07 November 2004
-------------------------

  * (7 Nov 2004) proper sub-classing
  	Now Tie::FieldVals::Select is a proper sub-class of Tie::FieldVals.
  Also renamed Tie::FieldVals::Join::Row to be Tie::FieldVals::Row::Join
  and made it a proper sub-class of Tie::FieldVals::Row.


0.40 Fri 05 November 2004
-------------------------

  * (5 Nov 2004) changed accessing of row hashes
  	I realized that, when I was using them, there were really
  only two ways I wanted to access the Tie::FieldVals::Row hashes:
  either as a reference to an array, because I wanted to go through
  every multi-valued item one at a time; or as a single scalar value
  (such as when printing out or comparing values).  Also because the
  $hash{$key=>$something} method of accessing things was annoying,
  because Perl kept on saying it was a syntax error, I simplified
  both FETCH and STORE operations for Tie::FieldVals::Row (and
  Tie::FieldVals::Join::Row).
  	Now there are three modes of FETCHing and two ways of
  STOREing.
  	The FETCH operation accepts:
    - a simple key, which gives a simple (possibly joined) value
    - a reference to a simple key, which gives a reference to an array
    - a reference to a hash or array of two values, one of which is the key,
    the other of which is the string with which to join multi-values.
  	The STORE operation only allows simple scalar keys, and accepts
  either a scalar or a reference to an array for the stored value.


0.31 Fri 05 November 2004
-------------------------

  * (5 Nov 2004) tweaking documentation


0.30 Thu 04 November 2004
-------------------------

  * (4 Nov 2004) improved sort is Nicer
  	Added two more sort types, "title" and "lastword".  This now
  eliminates the need to "nice-ify" fields because they'd been reversed
  for sort-order considerations, such as authors with Lastname,Firstname
  (can now be sorted with a "lastword" sort) or titles starting with "The"
  or "A" can now be sorted with "title" sort (which ignores the initial
  "The" or "A").

  * (4 Nov 2004) just tweaks

  * (3 Nov 2004) added ability to create file if it doesn't exist
  	One needs to set the mode to O_RDWR|O_CREAT and to give
  the field names, if one is creating the file; the default setup
  is still for a file which already exists.


0.20 Tue 02 November 2004
-------------------------

  * (2 Nov 2004) removed development support files from MANIFEST

  * (2 Nov 2004) added file locking
  	Basically uses the file locking of Tie::File.

  * (2 Nov 2004) improved documentation tweaks


0.10 Sun 31 October 2004
------------------------

  * (31 Oct 2004) added xml2fv script

  * (31 Oct 2004) added fv2xml script
  	Not just the script but the tests for it.

  * (31 Oct 2004) improving description
  	Added some more stuff to the DESCRIPTION comparing this to
  other kinds of data files.


0.01 Sun 31 October 2004
------------------------

  * (31 Oct 2004) added Join test

  * (31 Oct 2004) updated boringfile
  	Set a separate boringfile so that it considers the perl build
  files to be boring.

  * (30 Oct 2004) tweaking auto-build stuff
  	Setting the pre-build stuff, and auto-generating TODO and README.

  * (30 Oct 2004) improved documentation

  * (30 Oct 2004) tweaking tests
  	Removing some warnings and making safer.

  * (29 Oct 2004) more tests and fix
  	Fixed Row so that numeric compares of empty strings are done
  as a zero.  Added tests of simple functionality and selection.

  * (29 Oct 2004) initial checkin
  	This is stuff extracted out of the GenRepAr suite, and made into
  independent modules.
