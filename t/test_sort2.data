    "On display?  I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find
them."
    "That's the display department."
    "With a torch."
    "Ah, well the lights had probably gone."
    "So had the stairs."
    "But look, you found the notice didn't you?"
    "Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did.  It was on display in the bottom
of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign
on the door saying #Beware of the Leopard#."*

Quote:*What Robin Hood is to the English and John Henry to the American
Negroes, Elil-Hrair-Rah, El-ahrairah - The Prince with a Thousand Enemies -
is to rabbits. Uncle Remus might well have heard of him, for some of
El-ahrairah's adventures are those of Brair Rabbit. For that matter,
Odysseus himself might have borrowed a trick or two from the rabbit hero,
for he is very old and was never at a loss for a trick to decieve his
enemies.*
Comment:First of what later became its own genre of fantasy;
(realistic) animals as protagonists, with their own culture and myths.

Quote:*One day he was in very good spirits, for he had made a mirror
which had this peculiarity, that everything good and beautiful that was
reflected in it shrank together into almost nothing, but that whatever was
worthless and looked ugly became prominent and looked worse than ever.
The most lovely landscapes seen in this mirror looked like boiled spinach,
and the best people became hideous, or stood on their heads or had no
bodies; their faces were so distorted as to be unrecognisable, and a single
freckle was shown spread out over nose and mouth.*

Quote:*It is a truth universally aknowledged, that a single man in
posession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.
    However little known the feelings or views of such
a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well
fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as
the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.*

Quote:*The first week of August hangs at the very top of summer, the top of
the live-long year, like the highest seat of a Ferris wheel when it pauses
in its turning. The weeks that come before are only a climb from balmy
spring, and those that follow a drop to the chill of autumn, but the first
week of August is motionless, and hot.  It is curiously silent, too, with
blank white dawns and glaring noons, and sunsets smeared with too much
color.  Often at night there is lightning, but it quivers all alone. There
is no thunder, no relieving rain. These are strange and breathless days,
the dog days, when people are led to do things they are sure to be sorry
for later.*

She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer
the careless color of sea foam, but rather the color of snow falling
on a moonlit night.  But her eyes were still clear and unwearied,
and she still moved like a shadow on the sea.*

Quote:#The Microbe#

*The Microbe is so very small
You cannot make him out at all
But many sanguine people hope
To see him through a microscope.
His jointed tongue that lies beneath
A hundred curious rows of teeth;
His seven tufted tails with lots
Of lovely pink and purple spots,
On each of which a pattern stands,
Composed of forty separate bands;
His eyebrows of a tender green;
All these have never yet been seen --
But Scientists, who ought to know,
Assure us that they must be so...
Oh! let us never, never doubt
What nobody is sure about!*

Quote:*He was wearing a jumpsuit of radiation armor, colored white,
signifying executive level. He wore a white helmet with the visor down. He
was armed, as all executives were in this quasi-military installation. He
walked statelily across the floodlit concrete plain toward the giant hangar
looming in the night. His control seemed massive.
    As the towering hangar, shaped like a domed observatory, a squad of
black-armored guards lay dozing before an entry hatch. The executive kicked
the sergeant brutally but quite dispassionately. The squad leader exclaimed
and scrambled to his feet, followed by the rest of his men. They opened the
hatch for the man in white who stepped through into pitch black. Then,
almost as an afterthought, he turned back into the light, contemplated the
squad standing fearfully at attention and, quite dispassionately, shot
their sergeant.*
