El-ahrairah's adventures are those of Brair Rabbit. For that matter,
Odysseus himself might have borrowed a trick or two from the rabbit hero,

enemies.*

Quote:*One day he was in very good spirits, for he had made a mirror
which had this peculiarity, that everything good and beautiful that was
reflected in it shrank together into almost nothing, but that whatever was
worthless and looked ugly became prominent and looked worse than ever.
The most lovely landscapes seen in this mirror looked like boiled spinach,
and the best people became hideous, or stood on their heads or had no
bodies; their faces were so distorted as to be unrecognisable, and a single
freckle was shown spread out over nose and mouth.*

Quote:*The first week of August hangs at the very top of summer, the top of
the live-long year, like the highest seat of a Ferris wheel when it pauses
in its turning. The weeks that come before are only a climb from balmy
spring, and those that follow a drop to the chill of autumn, but the first
week of August is motionless, and hot.  It is curiously silent, too, with
blank white dawns and glaring noons, and sunsets smeared with too much
color.  Often at night there is lightning, but it quivers all alone. There
is no thunder, no relieving rain. These are strange and breathless days,
the dog days, when people are led to do things they are sure to be sorry
for later.*

Quote:#The Microbe#

*The Microbe is so very small
You cannot make him out at all
But many sanguine people hope
To see him through a microscope.
His jointed tongue that lies beneath
A hundred curious rows of teeth;
His seven tufted tails with lots
Of lovely pink and purple spots,
On each of which a pattern stands,
Composed of forty separate bands;
His eyebrows of a tender green;
All these have never yet been seen --
But Scientists, who ought to know,
Assure us that they must be so...
Oh! let us never, never doubt
What nobody is sure about!*

signifying executive level. He wore a white helmet with the visor down. He
was armed, as all executives were in this quasi-military installation. He
walked statelily across the floodlit concrete plain toward the giant hangar
looming in the night. His control seemed massive.
    As the towering hangar, shaped like a domed observatory, a squad of
black-armored guards lay dozing before an entry hatch. The executive kicked
the sergeant brutally but quite dispassionately. The squad leader exclaimed
and scrambled to his feet, followed by the rest of his men. They opened the
hatch for the man in white who stepped through into pitch black. Then,
almost as an afterthought, he turned back into the light, contemplated the
squad standing fearfully at attention and, quite dispassionately, shot
their sergeant.*

coins which he had laid out on the cobbles before him. The city rang
noisily about him as he regarded the results of his morning's work. Most of
the money he had begged. In a city full of beggars, he usually managed to
persuade some among the passing crowds to toss him the small change from
their money pouches.
    He did not pluck at their robes or whine, as the others did. He stood
quietly at their elbows while they considered some purchase in the markets
or in an open shop. Then, when they caught his grave eyes fixed upon them,
they often gave him some small coins while they swatted the other beggars
away from them.*

Quote:*We mutinied when we reached the ocean.
    We'd been riding for fifty-one days, three companies of us with half a
legion and two troops of Roman auxiliaries to guard us. We left Aquincum
late in July, and rode through the heat of August: the dust and the flies
were appalling. Most of the army bases where we stopped along the way
didn't have proper supplies laid up for such a large body of men, as nobody
had sent messages telling them to do so; of what they did have, the Roman
troops to the best for themselves, leaving us sour barley soup and coarse
black bread. We weren't used to the diet, and it made us ill.  The hooves
of our horses wore down on the paved Roman roads, and the beasts went lame.
The Romans refused to give us leather to make horse-sandals, so we cut up
the leather bindings of our wagon awnings.  Then, early in September when
we left the Rhine and turned west into Gaul, it began to rain, and the
water ran through the loose awnings and soaked everything: bedding, food,
clothes.  Everything stank of wet wool, wet horses, rotting barley, and
unwashed wet men, and we hated the feel of our own skins. Only our armor
and weapons were safe: they had been wrapped in oilcloths at Aquincum and
packed into twenty wagons of their own, which the Romans took charge of.*

Comment:R. U. R. stands for "Rossum's Universal Robots", and
this play is apparently the first place where the word "robot" was
used.  Very interesting from a history of SF perspective.  Notably
the robots here are more like what later SF would call androids.

read his Bible.  That was what was the matter with #him#.  When will
people understand that it is useless for a man to read his Bible
unless he also reads everyone else's Bible?  A printer reads a Bible
for misprints.  A Mormon reads his Bible and finds polygamy; a
Christian Scientist reads his and finds we have no arms and legs."*

Quote:*The human race, to which so many of my readers belong, has been
playing at children's games from the beginning, and will probably do it
till the end, which is a nuisance for the few people who grow up.  And
one of the games to which it is most attached is called "Keep to-morrow
dark," and which is also named (by the rustics in Shropshire, I have no
doubt) "Cheat the Prophet." The players listen very carefully and
respectfully to all that the clever men have to say about what is to
happen in the next generation. The players then wait until all the
clever men are dead, and bury them nicely. Then they go and do something
else. That is all. For a race of simple tastes, however, it is great
fun.*

Quote:It was the Ship.
    It had no other name.  It had thousands.
    From Tencton legends, it was *lesh*, the hell where the flesh of
those who turned their eyes from the three moons was seared in waves
of salt water, only to be restored with each rising of the sun.
    It was *am dugas*, the pit that tempted Celine from Andarko, from
which only their love had saved him.
    It was the *wask'l reckwi*, the knowing death of ancient times for
those who died yet remained forever awake to the darkness that trapped
them in an eternity of remembering the evil they had done.
    And there were other names, their numbers legion, more ancient than
any Tencton legend and not from any Tencton language.  Words of hatred
and fear and despair and helplessness that came from the languages of
other races that had been cargo in its hull, now ghosts whose death cries
still echoed from the bulkheads, whose terror still pulsed through the
choking air like the fluttering heartsbeat of a hunted animal run to
ground.
